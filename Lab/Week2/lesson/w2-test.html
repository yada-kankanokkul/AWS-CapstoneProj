<h1>Introduction to Serverless Computing</h1>
<p>One of the major benefits of cloud computing is its ability to abstract (hide) the infrastructure layer. This ability eliminates the need to manually manage the underlying physical hardware. In a serverless environment, this abstraction allows you to focus on the code for your applications without spending time building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. With serverless applications, there are never instances, operating systems, or servers to manage. AWS handles everything required to run and scale your application. By building serverless applications, your developers can focus on the code that makes your business unique.</p>
<h2>Serverless Operational Tasks </h2>
<p>The following chart compares the deployment and operational tasks in a traditional environment to those in a serverless environment. The serverless approach to development reduces overhead and lets you focus, experiment, and innovate faster.</p>
